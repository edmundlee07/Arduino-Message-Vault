# Arduino-Message-Vault

## Project Breakdown
<p>
  This is my first Arduino project made with lots of help from books, friends and the internet 
</p>

The Big Picture of this project was to ... 
  - Have a user input a message from the Arduino serial monitor
  - Program will contain a timer to give user 15 seconds to type and confirm their message and lock in a password
  - If not, message vault will restart 
  - Once message has been locked into the vualt, the user will haev to go through a sequence of button pushes before unlocking the message     again
  - A timer will continuously run giving a maximum limit of 15 seconds for the user to get the correct combinations
  - When the correct combinations of buttons are pressed, the user will be greeted with multiple flashing RGB LED’s and a nice noise on       the mini speaker
  - If the user fails to press the correct set of buttons, the LED’s will glow red and the speaker will play a nasty noise
  - When the puzzle is unlocked, the message will print back on screen
